This code is an event handler for a form submission. Upon submission, it gathers user-entered data (name and location), uses the getCoordinates function to fetch coordinates for the entered location, then utilizes these coordinates to retrieve weather data through the getWeather function and country-related information through the getCountryInfo function. The obtained data is displayed on the webpage in designated areas ('weatherData' and 'countryData').

The getCoordinates, getWeather, and getCountryInfo functions are asynchronous and utilize the fetch API to make HTTP requests to external services (Nominatim and Open Meteo APIs) to retrieve the required information based on the user's input.

Please note that this code assumes the availability and correctness of the APIs being used, and potential errors might arise due to network issues, API limitations, or incorrect user inputs.
